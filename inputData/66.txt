Apple Bottoms Jeans are definitely a denim fashion to look out for.

Recently we came across the Apple pocket pink stitch bootcut jeans.
These denim jeans have a pink flame stitch across the back.
The pockets are shaped like apples, and in the centre of the left pocket is Apple with the right pocket saying Bottoms.
The apple stem on the pockets is also highlighted in pink.
If you do not like pink then you have hundreds of other choices in stitching.
The jeans provide blue, gold, etc for colours inside the pockets.
The front of the Apple Bottoms jeans has a button and zip fly closure with front scoop pockets.
There are crinkled accents that run the length of the jeans.
You will also find a logo decal in the back loop.
This little decal is a bit unnecessary, but of course it advertises the brands.
This particular pair of jeans is styled in a boot cut providing a wider cuff at the bottom.
They are form fitting to accentuate a woman’s curves.
Sizes range from 6 to 14 UK.
The cost is £54.99, but well worth a comfortable pair of jeans.
